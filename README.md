This project is based on Original Gabriele Cirulli game: [Original Game](https://play2048.co/)

This project is a personal portfolio adaptation of the classic 2048 game, created by Gabriele Cirulli. Developed to demonstrate clean coding practices and JavaScript development skills, the game replicates the originalâ€™s minimalist design and intuitive gameplay, where players combine numbered tiles to reach the elusive 2048 tile. The project is a tribute to the iconic puzzle game and a showcase of interactive UI development and logic implementation in a real-world coding context.
